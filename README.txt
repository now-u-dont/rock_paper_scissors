**HTML and JS5**


Rock,Paper,Scissors Game


This is a simple Rock, Paper, Scissors game that I coded using Javascript. It was a fun little project I thought of making at 3 in the morning. This took about an hour and a half to code and style. I tested a few different ways to write the functions but ultimately decided to go with the if/else process.


I started with just a couple of h2's and button's for the HTML, and then went straight away to Javascript. The goal was to practice writing functions since I want to get better at it. I also wanted to add a game to my portfolio.


I definitely needed to Google a few things in my attempt to formulate the best function for this. I tested switch statements that did not work, and a few if/else statements that led me to the final one. Other than that, I think the part that took the most was trying to find the proper background for this. I started with the same design as shown in the final, but with a peacock blue background. I played around with the positions of the rock, paper, and scissors cliparts before sticking to the one shown in the final.


In conclusion, this is a nice little game that I really enjoyed making and also playing. I hope you like it too!
